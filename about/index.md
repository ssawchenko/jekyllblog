# Who am I?
Thanks for asking! I am a software developer located in Vancouver, BC. I love making applications that people WANT to use. After graduating from Simon Fraser University I began my journey into web development and have since moved into mobile application development, which is my current focus. In my free time I love to play games with friends and take pictures of things.
